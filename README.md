# AWSpractice
Amazon Web Services (AWS) is a comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud platform. I have this repo to continue to practice and learn about AWS for future implementations within projects and jobs.


Its services include computing power, storage options, networking, databases, analytics, application services, deployment, management, mobile, developer tools, and tools for the Internet of Things. The most common cloud computing types being Software as a Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).

By using AWS, I can leverage the power of cloud computing, to perform tasks from hosting a private blog to running complex, distributed applications, machine learning workloads, or big data analytics.

Advantages....
Scalability: AWS enables your applications to quickly scale up or down with demand. When you code with scalability in mind, you can ensure that your applications handle increased load efficiently.

Cost-Effectiveness: You pay only for the services you use in AWS, making it a cost-effective solution. Through code, you can manage and optimize your resource usage and costs.

Automation: Coding allows you to automate many tasks that could be time-consuming if done manually, like the one in the example - uploading files to S3 and listing them.

Integration: AWS offers a vast array of services. Coding allows you to integrate these services in your applications.

Customization: Coding gives you the ability to create custom solutions tailored to your specific needs.

Learning: Practicing coding with AWS services gives you a deeper understanding of cloud computing concepts and AWS service offerings, making you a more competent developer or cloud engineer.
